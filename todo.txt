gil: add passThruCreatures/tunnel param
opb: pass false false
playerCancelBlink    <
monstBlink2Pref      <
WhipAttack           these are all fine

opb: <-- add openBoltPathBetween to replace some; only obpb has ptc/tunnel params
generallyvalidbolttarget: opb --> obpb pass ptc/tunnel
creatureIsTargetable: throwCommand add right click auto targeting change
                      opb --> obpb
                      pass params?
awarenessDistance: nothing changes?
updatemonsterstate: determine closest feared enemy; nothing changes
nexttargetafter needs to handle target forcing or have a return value telling whether or not something needs to be forced
                pass depending on context, figure this out later

monstercastspell: change creature to location
generallyvalidbolttarget gets ptc/tunnel

obpb: this is literally searchForTarget lmao
      guess you gotta add the params to searchTarget too

gil is not called with passThruCreatures except through openPathBetween
--> add obpb

gil will take into account the bolt being used/whether item or not:
